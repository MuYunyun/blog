Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that `adjacent houses have security systems connected` and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.\n\nGiven an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.\n\nExample 1:\n\n```js\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,1]\nOutput: 4\n```\n\nExplanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).\nTotal amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nExample 2:\n\n```js\nInput: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]\nOutput: 12\n```\n\nExplanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).\nTotal amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.\n\n* Constraints:\n  * 1 <= nums.length <= 100\n  * 0 <= nums[i] <= 400\n\n### Analyze\n\n思考🤔: `curNode 最大值` = `curNode 最大值` + Math.max(`curNode + 2 最大值`, `curNode + 3 最大值`, ...)\n\n```js\n/**\n * @param {number[]} nums\n * @return {number}\n */\nvar rob = function(nums) {\n  let sum = 0\n  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {\n    sum = sum + Math.max(, )\n  }\n\n  return sum\n}\n```\n\n考虑偷取 [0...x] 方位内的房子"}}]);
