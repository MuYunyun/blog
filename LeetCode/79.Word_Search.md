### 79.Word Search

Given an `m x n` board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where "adjacent" cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The `same letter cell may not be used more than once`.

Example 1:

```js
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCCED"
Output: true
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/word-1.jpg)

```js
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "SEE"
Output: true
```

Example 3:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/15/word3.jpg)

```js
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCB"
Output: false
```

Constraints:

* m === board.length
* n === board[i].length
* 1 <= m, n <= 200
* 1 <= word.length <= 103
* board and word consists only of lowercase and uppercase English letters.

### Analyze

```js
/**
 * @param {character[][]} board
 * @param {string} word
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var exist = function(board, word) {

};
```
